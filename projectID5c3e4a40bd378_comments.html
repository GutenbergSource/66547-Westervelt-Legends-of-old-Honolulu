<HTML><BODY>The final collection of Hawaiian stories by the American author W.D. Westervelt I will be running through PGDP now. This collection about Old Honolulu completes the available scan-sets that can be added to PG.

<p>As usual with my projects, I've placed unnumbered plates at the end of the volume. Sometimes in the B&amp;W page-images, the text may be hard to read. The full-color plates are also in the project and may be easier to read. No further difficulties expected, so have fun! </p></BODY></HTML>
